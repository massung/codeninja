This is a fork of the [Jekyll-Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) theme. A hearty thanks to [Josh Gerdes](https://github.com/joshgerdes) for making and sharing it with everyone.

The background is "Hundred Eyes" from [Marco Polo](https://www.netflix.com/title/80083594).

The ninja icon was created by [Metropolicons](https://metropolicons.com).
