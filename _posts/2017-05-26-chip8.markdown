Last Christmas I had some spare time and just felt like coding something up. I was feeling not only a bit nostalgic, So, I decided to write a CHIP-8 emulator; something very doable within a week off work.

But, then the week went by, and while the emulator was fine, I wasn't quite content. Most of the games for it were terribly coded and so I was going to have to program a few of my own. Fast forward another few days and I had a CHIP-8 assembler along with debugger and output log.

Feel free to download it, play some CHIP-8 games, and create some of your own. 

Enjoy!
