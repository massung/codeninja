For a little side-project I'm building in [ScalaJS][scalajs] (which I'll post about in the near future) I wanted to use the [Mousetrap][mousetrap] library.

So, I whipped up a little [ScalaJS facade][facade] for it and thought I would make it available for others as well. It's not especially large or difficult, but maybe it'll save others a little time.

Head over to [JitPack][jitpack] to use it, or clone it from [GitHub][facade].

And if you find something wrong - or have a better way of doing something in the facade - please, open an issue and tell me about it!
