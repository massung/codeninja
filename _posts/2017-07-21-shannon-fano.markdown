For another project I'm working on I needed to [Shannon-Fano][1] encode text strings into bit vectors. So, I cranked out a [Go][2] package real quick and thought others might find it useful as well.

Aside from - well - encoding, I wanted to be sure the table could be serialized using [encoding/gob][3], that way it would be possible to use the encoding (and decoding) via files and even over the network. There's an example of doing this in the [README][4].

Cheers! I hope you find it useful.
